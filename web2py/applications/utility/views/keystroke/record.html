        <p>
            For your mood and emotion data to be valid, we have to make sure that
            exactly one physical person is answering the questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the start of each HIT, we will verify your identity using a "biometric"
            sign-in system based on <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_dynamics">keystroke dynamics</a>.
            Every person has a unique typing pattern that can be used to identify them.
            The computer detects the unique pattern that you use to press keys.
